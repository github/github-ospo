# OSPO Newsletter
GitHub OSPO publishes internal newsletters on a monthly cadence in order to keep Hubbers informed and up to date. This is a practice that we find critical to providing awareness to our policies and procedures. We also like to recognize Hubbers for their own open source work.

We utilize GitHub discussions to post our newsletters and keep an index of past newsletters as shown below.
