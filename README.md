# github-ospo

Helping open source program offices get started

The purpose of this repo is to enable new OSPOs to be successful on GitHub. On behalf of the GitHub OSPO we are sharing our policies, tools, and best practices to guide you through the first 6-12 months of your organization's open source journey. There are also other OSPO guides and resources available through [TODO](https://todogroup.org/) & [OSPO Alliance](https://ospo.zone/) as well as [opensource.guide](https://opensource.guide/). This repo will focus on GitHub related tools and content.

## Adopting and adapting

Feel free to use, modify, and adopt these policies, procedures, and guides. They are open source! :tada: If you are adopting them, run through and do a quick search for the following:

- `XXX`
- `<COMPANY_NAME>`
- `<LEGAL_CONTACT>`
- `<OPEN_SOURCE_MAILBOX>`

We have used those as placeholder values where our policies point to internal only documentation, internal teams, or to GitHub as a company rather than the product. Also search for the `@` so that you can update any email addresses with the proper ones for your company.

## Actions

In addition to the information in this repository, we've also released a number of GitHub Actions that can help OSPOs track activity, clean house, and automate other useful activities. The actions are released in separate repos but are all linked here for convenience.

- [github/stale-repos](https://github.com/github/stale-repos) - Identify and report on repositories with no activity for configurable amount of time, in order to surface inactive repos to be considered for archival
- [github/contributors](https://github.com/github/contributors) - Given an organization or repository, produces information about the contributors over the specified time period.
