# 🛳️ Release policy 

While releasing GitHub code as open source is highly encouraged, we also need to be mindful that we shouldn't be giving away code that 
could be used by competitors to undermine our core business.

## 🖇️ Process

All open sourcing of GitHub source code and content (e.g., text, images, fonts, data)
should be registered by following the release process at XXX repo. 
If it's truly [a personal project](https://github.com/github/balanced-employee-ip-agreement), not created as [part of your job](XXX), related to GitHub's business, or incorporating GitHub's intellectual property, 
this policy does not apply. Just take care to not imply any endorsement by GitHub. If you have any uncertainty talk with your manager,
your HR business partner, or a member of the legal team.

If you are looking to release non-product code (such as utility libraries, tools, and sample code), complete the registration process. It will not require further review if the following conditions are met:

- ✔️ You exercise good judgment and only release open source in the best interest of GitHub. 
- ✔️ You release under the MIT license. 
- ✔️ The release does not collect telemetry.
- ✔️ The release does not contain cryptography.
- ✔️ The release does not contain data. 

## 🏡 Location

All GitHub open source on GitHub must live in a [GitHub-managed organization](XXX). These are projects that Hubbers create as part of their jobs. 
Of course existing projects with their own multi-stakeholder governance like Homebrew belong within that community.
But the vast majority of projects will go into the [GitHub organization](https://github.com/github). 

## ✏️ Security 

All GitHub open source code must follow all applicable security requirements
related to our [software development lifecycle](XXX).

## 📖 License

All GitHub open source code must be released under the MIT license. Where we
are participating in existing community that does not use the MIT license, work
with legal to determine the appropriate license. Our
intention is to fit in with the existing community. We just need to confirm that
the terms work for the business.

## 📤 Contributions

Contributions to a GitHub-managed open source project are made under the project license in an inbound==outbound model.
