## Prerequisites for running and testing code

These are one time installations required to be able to test your changes locally as part of the pull request (PR) submission process.

1. install Go [through download](https://go.dev/doc/install) | [through Homebrew](https://formulae.brew.sh/formula/go)
1. [install golangci-lint](https://golangci-lint.run/usage/install/#local-installation)

## Submitting a pull request

1. [Fork][fork] and clone the repository
1. Configure and install the dependencies: `script/bootstrap`
1. Make sure the tests pass on your machine: `go test -v ./...`
1. Make sure linter passes on your machine: `golangci-lint run`
1. Create a new branch: `git checkout -b my-branch-name`
1. Make your change, add tests, and make sure the tests and linter still pass
1. Push to your fork and [submit a pull request][pr]

Here are a few things you can do that will increase the likelihood of your pull request being accepted:
